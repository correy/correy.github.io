          <div class="f4 fw6 near-black mb2">Slater Systems, LLC <i class="f5 mid-gray fr">April 2018 - June 2019</i> </div>
          <div class="f5 dark-gray mb2">Slater is <span class="near-black">a new kind of software</span> for all devices, built on event-sourcing over end-to-end encrypted messaging. It's gradually-specified, flow-based logic in secure messaging threads (with or without other humans chatting in them). It enables a "Wizard of Oz" approach where you can pretend to be the software you want in order to capture user story data before really implementing it. It integrates all kinds of graphical widgets as message types, with slash commands, and later, optional conversational AI running <i>in situ</i>. And then it tiles these message threads over as many devices as you can throw at it, homogenizing and integrating devices.</div>
          <div class="f5 dark-gray mb2">I've failed to balance this pursuit with paying work, and I've made a mess of the project and my life because of it... but I still think it was worth it, to explore the space that I see. And my guts concur. Software ate the world, but now Slater wants to eat all that software.</div>
          <div class="mid-gray"><span class="near-black">used:</span> JavaScript, NodeJS, FaunaDB, Choo, Tachyons, Sodium, Wire Open Source, forrays into the hypercore (DAT) ecosystem for evaluation / discussion</div>

          <div class="f4 fw6 near-black mb2">Lucian Software, LLC <i class="f5 mid-gray fr">June 2015 - August 2016</i> </div>
          <div class="f5 dark-gray mb2">Built many prototypes / demos of "headless Shopify" apps / widgets before that was a thing. Attempted to build a productized consulting business around that concept, but was overwhelmed. Spent too much time trying to hunt and close clients. (How do I do sales?) Started forming the concepts that would become "Slater". Launched "stepping stone product", talky.cards, a web interface to API.ai (now DialogFlow).</div>
          <div class="mid-gray"><span class="near-black">used:</span> JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Python, Shopify, Dialogflow, Stripe, Rasa.ai, RethinkDB, Choo, Tachyons, lots of other stuff</div>

          <div class="f4 fw6 near-black mb2">Lucian Games, LLC <i class="f5 mid-gray fr">July 2011 - September 2014</i> </div>
          <div class="f5 dark-gray mb2">Built many game prototypes in several genres, using a wide variety of languages, frameworks, and engines. Shipped one title, "Oware: Earth's Oldest Living Board Game", in Apple's App Store, Android Market (Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luciangames.oware&hl=en_US), and several others</div>
